  <h3><strong><ins>About Me:</ins></strong></h3>
      <p>I am a born-and-raised New Yorker, who recently moved to the West Coast to work in tech. I graduated from a small Liberal Arts College in 2010 and went on to pursue my masters at Northeastern University and graduated in 2015. I live in Seattle and work at Microsoft leading analyst relations for Azure Core Platform. I have been working in tech for almost 10 years in various capacities from market resaerch to corporate communciations. I've always been passionate about technology, especially consumer technology and have wanted to learn coding and decided to take Epicodus' Intro to Programming class to provide a structured environment to learn languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. </p>
      <p>When I'm not steeped in tech and learning to code, I also shoot landscape photography and am learning how to dj. Along with my husband, we have an animal house with two dogs and two cats, who keep us on our toes.</p>
